Hi this is Ayush Singh and this is my repository for the tasks given to me by the IT company "BHARAT INTERN" where i am currently working as a "DATA SCIENCE INTERN". The 03 repository consists of the task 03
Project Title: Image Classification of Cats and Dogs using CNN
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to implement a CNN to classify images of cats and dogs. By leveraging the CNN algorithm, we aim to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between the two categories using image data from the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset.

Project Description:
In this project, we focus on building a robust image classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The dataset utilized for this project is the popular Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, which consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.

The project workflow includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset containing images of cats and dogs.
Preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size and converting them to grayscale.
Normalize the pixel values to ensure consistency across all images.
Feature Extraction:

Extract meaningful features from the images using techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or other feature descriptors.
Create a feature matrix that will serve as input to the SVM classifier.
Model Development:

Implement the SVM algorithm to classify the images.
Train the SVM model using a portion of the dataset and validate it using cross-validation techniques.
Fine-tune the hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Assess the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure its generalizability.
Prediction and Analysis:

Use the trained SVM model to classify new images of cats and dogs.
Analyze the classification results to identify any areas for improvement.
Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for image classification tasks. By accurately classifying images of cats and dogs, the SVM model showcases its capability in handling complex image data and making precise predictions.

The project underscores the importance of feature extraction and preprocessing in achieving high classification accuracy. The SVM algorithm, known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, proved to be a suitable choice for this image classification task.

Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in working with image data, preprocessing techniques, and implementing SVM for classification. The insights derived from this project highlight the potential of SVM in real-world applications involving image recognition and classification.

I am grateful to Bharat Intern for providing me with the opportunity to undertake this project as part of their Machine Learning Internship Program. Their guidance and support have been pivotal in the successful completion of this project.
